I’m a high school student from the San Francisco Bay Area. I harness the power of policy, advocacy, storytelling, and data to catalyze change. My activism centers on achieving fair, equitable AI, especially within the criminal justice system. I’m the founder and president of Encode Justice, a youth-powered organization leading a global movement for human rights and justice under AI through political advocacy, community organizing, educational programming, and content creation. We champion informed AI policy that confronts the bias, discrimination, and surveillance enabled by systems ranging from facial recognition technology to risk assessment tools.  I also write about social and political issues while tackling impact-driven projects in computer science and volunteering for congressional campaigns. The picture above is from Petra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Jordan, and you can find my other travel pictures [here](https://vsco.co/sneharevanur/gallery).
