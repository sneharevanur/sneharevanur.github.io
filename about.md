Iâ€™m a high school student from the Bay Area interested in criminal justice, writing, and impact-driven computer science. I love to travel, most recently visiting Greece and Turkey with my family! The picture above is from a Petra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Jordan, and you can find my other travel pictures [here](https://vsco.co/sneharevanur/gallery).
